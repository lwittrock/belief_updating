        Welcome to this study conducted by researchers at Maastricht University.
        In this study you will be able to earn money based on the choices you make.
        You will earn a fixed participation fee of {{ session.config.participation_fee }} for completing the study.
        Depending on your choices in the study, you may earn substantially more.
        We have calibrated the payments so that participants can expect to earn <strong> â‚¬?? on average</strong>. Your precise payments can, however,
        be larger or smaller depending on your decisions during the study.
    </p>

        The study will take on average around 25 minutes. It is important to note that we apply
        a strict "no-deception" rule, meaning that everything we write is true and implemented exactly as described.
        The study was ethically approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Inner-City
        Faculties of Maastricht University.

        Before you begin, please turn off your phone/e-mails/music so that you can concentrate on this study. Thank you!
